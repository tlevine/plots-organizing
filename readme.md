# How to organize a public lab chapter #

You want to organize a bunch of people to do some project.

You need to connect people in these groups.

* People with expertise who want to do something.
* People with environmental concern who want to do something.
* People who want gear who want something done with it.

Tack your project onto an existing group or project.
For example, if there is already a group who goes canoing,
suggest bringing kites along to take pictures. Or, if a
group is already concerned about an issue similar to yours.

Understand the area of interest before observing it.
